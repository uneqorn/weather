# Let's say you want to write a script in python that is able to pull the current weather in any location that is specified in a text field (with auto-complete on the location names by city, state, country).

# Here is a script that will do this using the OpenWeatherMap API:

import requests
import json

# OpenWeatherMap API key
api_key = 'your_api_key_here'

# base URL for the OpenWeatherMap API
base_url = 'https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?'

# function to get the weather data for a specific location
def get_weather(location):
  # build the full URL for the request
  full_url = base_url + 'q=' + location + '&appid=' + api_key
  
  # make the request
  response = requests.get(full_url)
  
  # if the request was successful, parse the data and return it
  if response.status_code == 200:
    data = json.loads(response.text)
    return data
  # if the request failed, return None
  else:
    return None

# test the function
location = 'Seattle, WA, USA'
weather_data = get_weather(location)

if weather_data is not None:
  print(f'The current temperature in {location} is {weather_data["main"]["temp"]} degrees Fahrenheit.')
else:
  print('Unable to get weather data for the specified location.')
