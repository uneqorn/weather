# To create a form on your website that allows users to enter a location, you can use an HTML <form> element with an <input> element inside it. Here is an example of how you could do this:

<form id="location-form">
  <label for="location">Location:</label><br>
  <input type="text" id="location" name="location"><br>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
