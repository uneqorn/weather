# how may i handle the AJAX request by calling the `get_weather()` function and returning the weather data to the client?
# To handle the AJAX request by calling the get_weather() function and returning the weather data to the client, you will need to set up a server-side script that can receive the request and call the get_weather() function.
# Here is an example of how you could do this using Python and the Flask framework:

from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/get-weather', methods=['POST'])
def get_weather_ajax():
  # get the location from the request
  location = request.form['location']
  
  # call the get_weather() function
  weather_data = get_weather(location)
  
  # return the weather data as a JSON object
  return jsonify(weather_data)


# This script will create a Flask app with a route that handles POST requests to the /get-weather URL. The route gets the location from the request and calls the get_weather() function, then returns the weather data as a JSON object using the jsonify() function from Flask.
# You will need to make sure that the get_weather() function is available to this script. You can do this by placing the function in a separate module and importing it, or by defining it in the same script.
# To use this script, you will need to run it on a server and make sure that it is accessible from your website. You can then send an AJAX request to the /get-weather URL from your JavaScript code and handle the response by updating the page with the weather data.
# I hope this is helpful! Please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like more information.
