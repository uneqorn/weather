# how may i handle the AJAX request by calling the `get_weather()` function and returning the weather data to the client?
# To handle the AJAX request by calling the get_weather() function and returning the weather data to the client, you will need to set up a server-side script that can receive the request and call the get_weather() function.
# Here is an example of how you could do this using Python and the Flask framework:

from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/get-weather', methods=['POST'])
def get_weather_ajax():
  # get the location from the request
  location = request.form['location']
  
  # call the get_weather() function
  weather_data = get_weather(location)
  
  # return the weather data as a JSON object
  return jsonify(weather_data)
