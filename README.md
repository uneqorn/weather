# weather
a weather forecast script for websites
This script lets you add a weather forecast script and web based functionality to any website you control, that is hosted and connected to the Internet.
It uses open source code and API connections, as well as python, AJAX and JavaScript.

# how can i use that on my website?
To use the script on your website, you will need to do the following:
1. Host the script on a server. This could be a server that you set up yourself, or it could be a server provided by a hosting service.
2. Modify the script to return the weather data in a format that is suitable for your website. For example, you might want to return the data as a JSON object or as an HTML string.
3. Create a form on your website that allows users to enter a location. You can use an HTML <input> element for this.
4. Use JavaScript to send an AJAX request to the server when the user submits the form. The request should include the location that the user entered.
5. On the server, handle the AJAX request by calling the get_weather() function and returning the weather data to the client.
6. On the client, use JavaScript to parse the weather data and display it on the page.

# how may i host the script on a server?
There are many ways to host a script on a server, depending on your needs and resources. Here are a few options:
1. Host the script on a physical server that you set up yourself. This requires purchasing and setting up hardware, as well as installing and configuring an operating system and any necessary software.
2. Host the script on a virtual private server (VPS). A VPS is a virtual machine that you can rent from a hosting provider. You will have full control over the server and can install and configure any software that you need.
3. Host the script on a cloud hosting service like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform, or Microsoft Azure. These services provide a range of hosting options, including virtual servers, containers, and serverless platforms, and offer a variety of tools and services for building, deploying, and managing applications.
4. Host the script on a platform as a service (PaaS) provider like Heroku or AppFog. PaaS providers offer a pre-configured platform for building and deploying applications, and handle the infrastructure and scaling for you.
I hope this is helpful! Please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like more information on any of these options.
