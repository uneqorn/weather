# how may i use javascript to send an AJAX request to the server when the user submits the form? please include the location that the user entered.
# To use JavaScript to send an AJAX request to the server when the user submits the form, you can use the submit event of the form element and the XMLHttpRequest object.
# First, add an id attribute to the form element and use it to get a reference to the form in your JavaScript code:

<form id="location-form">
  <!-- form elements here -->
</form>
